### Notes

-  The frontend of this project was started on 21MAY21 and was editted multiple times.  Then main focus of frontend was rendering a clean, colorful, and beautiful UI, full CRUD routes for the three pages (run, hike, scenic) of the On The Run app.  The original creator of the repo was Katherine and the author of the first pull request was Garrett.  After a couple days the team added Ian Rackson.  All together they proceeded to put together an amazing app that was visually beautiful and functional.  Will contributed authorization code as well.  The success of the frontend was really driven by Garrett, Katherine, and Ian.
-  The key features were the visual design, dark mode, and google maps.  The reason these were key were because Users really enjoy compelling visual design, the ability to customize their experience of the app, and also like knowing or showing off where they have been or where they would like to go.  These features really enhanced the UX and brought the app in line with other social media apps on the market.
-  The big challenge was deployment.  When deployment issues arose, Kathrine and Ian were key in editing the code to make sure it was deployable.  Without the team of Ian and Katherine problem shooting deployment, this project would not have been as successful as it was.
-  Going forward, a feature that would be extremely useful would be uploading pictures from a mobile device.  Another feature would be being able to add the route a user travelled much like Strava.
-  Ultimately, the On The Run app provides a simple way to post a user's run, hike, or scenic walk for all to see with a clean and colorful UI.
-  In conclussion, this was a team effort.  Everyone contributed key code and provided exceptional effort to make this app visually beautiful, functional, and the project successful.
